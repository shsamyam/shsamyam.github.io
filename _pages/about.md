I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). I am an applied microeconomist specializing in agricultural and labor economics with a focus on U.S. agricultural labor, trade, firm dynamics, and immigration policy. I am on the 2024-25 job market.

[Trade Effects of Immigration Enforcement: Evidence from U.S. Labor-Intensive Agriculture](https://shsamyam.org/files/JMP.pdf) [Job Market paper]

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
    In recent decades, the farm labor supply in the U.S., which relies heavily on foreign-born workers, has declined, farm labor markets have tightened, and producers have reported labor shortages and rising wages. During this time, U.S. labor-intensive fruit and vegetable (FV) production has reduced, and imports and trade deficits have significantly increased. Connecting these trends, this study examines whether intensified immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, a supply-side shock to farm labor availability, affects domestic and international FV trade flows. First, I demonstrate that a state's FV production decreases with the intensification of immigration enforcement. Using reduced-form gravity models, I then show that immigration enforcement reduces FV exports to other U.S. states and foreign trading partners. I also show that a stateâ€™s FV imports from other U.S. states increase with enforcement intensity, especially from states with lower enforcement levels. Most of these effects are driven by police-based rather than employment-based enforcement. However, I do not find evidence that immigration enforcement contributes to the rise in international FV imports. These results have important implications for U.S. agricultural and trade policy, food supply systems, and consumer welfare.

[Labor Market Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis in Brazil](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04201) (with [Hugo Sant'Anna](https://hsantanna.org/)) [R&R **_Journal of Economic Geography_**]

    We use administrative panel data on the universe of Brazilian formal workers to investigate the labor market effects of the Venezuelan crisis in Brazil, focusing on the border state of Roraima. The results using difference-in-differences show that the monthly wages of Brazilians in Roraima increased by around 2 percent, which was mostly driven by those working in sectors and occupations with no refugee involvement. The study finds negligible job displacement for Brazilians but finds evidence of native workers moving to occupations without immigrants. We also find that immigrants in the informal market offset the substitution effects in the formal market.

Immigration Enforcement and Business Dynamics (with [Hugo Sant'Anna](https://hsantanna.org/))

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
    We examine whether reducing the undocumented immigrant population affects business dynamics by leveraging the spatiotemporal variations in the implementation of the Secure Communities (SC) program, which coordinates data sharing between local law enforcement agencies to identify and arrest undocumented immigrants. Using difference-in-differences models with the 2001-12 county-level business dynamics panel data, we find that SC implementation at the commuting-zone level reduced the number of firms, establishments, and employment, increased establishment exits, and decreased establishment entries and job creation in the construction sector, but not in other labor-intensive sectors. We discuss several potential mechanisms, including entrepreneurial out-migration, higher labor costs, and changes in consumption.
