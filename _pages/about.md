I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). I am an applied microeconomist specializing in agricultural and labor economics with a focus on U.S. agricultural labor, trade, firm dynamics, and immigration policy. I am on the 2024-25 job market.
