I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). My research overlaps agricultural, labor, and public economics. I am interested in topics related to U.S. agricultural labor and the causes and effects of (im)migration shocks.
