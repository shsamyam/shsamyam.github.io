I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). My research interests lie at the intersections of labor economics, agricultural economics, and economic development. My research broadly falls into two thematic areas: examining the impacts of policies and shocks on the labor market, and investigating how labor market policies and shocks influence various outcomes. Much of my work is related to migration and migration policy in some capacity. I am also a Consultant at The World Bank. I will be in the 2024-25 job market.
