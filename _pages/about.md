I am a Ph.D. candidate, currently in my third year, in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). I am also a consultant at The World Bank. My research interests lie at the intersections of labor economics, agricultural economics, and economic development.
