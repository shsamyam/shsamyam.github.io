I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). My research interests lie at the intersections of labor economics, agricultural economics, and economic development. Much of my current research focuses on the impacts of (im)migration shocks. I will be on the 2024/25 job market.
