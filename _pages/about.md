I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersections of labor economics, agricultural economics, and economic development. Currently, I am also working as a Consultant at the World Bank Group.
