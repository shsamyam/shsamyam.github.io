I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). My research interests lie at the intersections of labor economics, agricultural economics, and economic development. I am also a Consultant at The World Bank.
