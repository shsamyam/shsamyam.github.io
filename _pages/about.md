I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersections of labor economics, agricultural economics, economic development, and demography. My ongoing research focuses on the United States as well as developing countries.

I hold a Bachelor of Business Information Systems (B.B.I.S.) from Kathmandu University in Nepal and an M.S. in Applied Economics from Montana State University.

Prior to joining the doctoral program, I worked as a Research Consultant at [Precision Development (PxD)](https://precisiondev.org/). I have also worked on several impact evaluation projects in Nepal, including as a research assistant for the [evaluation](https://basis.ucdavis.edu/project/evaluation-welfare-impacts-livestock-transfer-program-nepal) of the welfare impacts of a capital transfer program.
