I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu). I am an applied microeconomist specializing in agricultural and labor economics with a focus on U.S. agricultural labor, trade, firm dynamics, and immigration policy. I am on the 2024-25 job market.

    In recent decades, the farm labor supply in the U.S., which relies heavily on foreign-born workers, has declined, farm labor markets have tightened, and producers have reported labor shortages and rising wages. During this time, U.S. labor-intensive fruit and vegetable (FV) production has reduced, and imports and trade deficits have significantly increased. Connecting these trends, this study examines whether intensified immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, a supply-side shock to farm labor availability, affects domestic and international FV trade flows. First, I demonstrate that a state's FV production decreases with the intensification of immigration enforcement. Using reduced-form gravity models, I then show that immigration enforcement reduces FV exports to other U.S. states and foreign trading partners. I also show that a stateâ€™s FV imports from other U.S. states increase with enforcement intensity, especially from states with lower enforcement levels. Most of these effects are driven by police-based rather than employment-based enforcement. However, I do not find evidence that immigration enforcement contributes to the rise in international FV imports. These results have important implications for U.S. agricultural and trade policy, food supply systems, and consumer welfare.
