I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu) specializing in agricultural and labor economics. My research focuses on U.S. agricultural labor, trade, firm dynamics, and immigration policy. I am on the 2024-25 job market.

[Trade Effects of Immigration Enforcement: Evidence from U.S. Labor-Intensive Agriculture](https://shsamyam.org/files/JMP.pdf) [Job Market paper]

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
    In recent decades, the farm labor supply in the U.S., which relies heavily on foreign-born workers, has declined, farm labor markets have tightened, and producers have reported labor shortages and rising wages. During this time, U.S. labor-intensive fruit and vegetable (FV) production has reduced, and imports and trade deficits have significantly increased. Connecting these trends, this study examines whether intensified immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, a supply-side shock to farm labor availability, affects domestic and international FV trade flows. First, I demonstrate that a state's FV production decreases with the intensification of immigration enforcement. Using reduced-form gravity models, I then show that immigration enforcement reduces FV exports to other U.S. states and foreign trading partners. I also show that a stateâ€™s FV imports from other U.S. states increase with enforcement intensity, especially from states with lower enforcement levels. Most of these effects are driven by police-based rather than employment-based enforcement. However, I do not find evidence that immigration enforcement contributes to the rise in international FV imports. These results have important implications for U.S. agricultural and trade policy, food supply systems, and consumer welfare.

[Labor Market Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis in Brazil](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04201) (with [Hugo Sant'Anna](https://hsantanna.org/)) [R&R **_Journal of Economic Geography_**]

    We use administrative panel data on the universe of Brazilian formal workers to investigate the labor market effects of the Venezuelan crisis in Brazil, focusing on the border state of Roraima. The results using difference-in-differences show that the monthly wages of Brazilians in Roraima increased by around 2 percent, which was mostly driven by those working in sectors and occupations with no refugee involvement. The study finds negligible job displacement for Brazilians but finds evidence of native workers moving to occupations without immigrants. We also find that immigrants in the informal market offset the substitution effects in the formal market.

Immigration Enforcement and Business Dynamics (with [Hugo Sant'Anna](https://hsantanna.org/))

  <summary style="cursor: pointer;">Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
    We examine whether reducing the undocumented immigrant population affects business dynamics by leveraging the spatiotemporal variations in the implementation of the Secure Communities (SC) program, which coordinates data sharing between local law enforcement agencies to identify and arrest undocumented immigrants. Using difference-in-differences models with the 2001-12 county-level business dynamics panel data, we find that SC implementation at the commuting-zone level reduced the number of firms, establishments, and employment, increased establishment exits, and decreased establishment entries and job creation in the construction sector, but not in other labor-intensive sectors. We discuss several potential mechanisms, including entrepreneurial out-migration, higher labor costs, and changes in consumption.

The Effects of Crime on Firm Entry and Exit: Evidence from Rio de Janeiro (with [Hugo Sant'Anna](https://hsantanna.org/))
<details style="margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 0.9em">
  <summary style="cursor: pointer;">Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
    This paper examines the effects of crime on firm entry and exit in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, using data on the universe of firms and establishments in the city from 2007 to 2017. By spatially locating firms and merging this information with granular neighborhood-level crime data, which includes detailed records of crime type, time, and severity, we investigate how crime influences the local business environment. We address endogeneity and simultaneity issues through an instrumental variable approach, leveraging spatiotemporal variations in the Pacifying Police Unit program that deployed the Brazilian military across Rio de Janeiro neighborhoods. Our hypothesis is that firms are more likely to enter areas where crime has been reduced and less likely to exit them. We explore heterogeneity at the level of crime type, firm size, industry, and productivity distribution.

The Effects of Import Competition on U.S. Fruit and Vegetable Sector
<details style="margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 0.9em">
  <summary style="cursor: pointer;">Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
Over recent decades, the U.S. fruit and vegetable sector has experienced a sharp increase in both the volume and market share of imports, driven by an open domestic import regime and increased competition from low-cost foreign producers. During the same period, there has been a reduction in the production of major fruit and vegetable crops in the U.S. In this paper, I examine the effects of import competition by constructing a county-by-crop-year measure of the competition shock intensity and using an instrumental variable that exploits export growth of fruit and vegetable crops from U.S. import partners to non-U.S. markets, isolating supply-side variations in foreign competition that are independent of U.S. domestic demand conditions. I address four key questions: How does import competition affect U.S. domestic fruit and vegetable production? What are its effects on producer performance, productivity, and profitability? What are the potential consequences of limiting fruit and vegetable imports on domestic producers? And how do these effects vary across farm size and productivity distributions? The findings aim to inform agricultural trade policy and the resilience of U.S. producers in an increasingly competitive global fruit and vegetable market.
