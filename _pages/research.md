[Labor Market Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis in Brazil](SantAnnaShrestha2023) (with [Hugo Sant'Anna](https://hsantanna.org/)) [[Arxiv Working Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04201)] *(Submitted)*

We use administrative panel data on the universe of Brazilian formal workers to investigate the labor market effects of the Venezuelan crisis in Brazil, focusing on the state of Roraima, where the crisis had a direct impact. The results, using difference-in-differences, show that the average monthly wage of Brazilians in Roraima increased by 3 percent compared to control states. This was primarily driven by a wage increase among those working in economic sectors and occupations with little to no involvement of refugees. Those involved in sectors and occupations with a higher share of refugees did not experience an adverse wage effect either. The study found negligible forced job displacement of Brazilian workers and evidence of them moving to occupations with fewer immigrant shares. We also find suggestive evidence that the presence of immigrants in the informal labor market offset the negative substitution effects in the formal market.
